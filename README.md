## Full stack all day immersive bootcamp: 
First two folders are Python related and 2nd week folder has tic-tac-toe game completed, 1st week folder has more exercise on Python. At bootcamp everything moves very quickly, it is all about hands-on exercises and projects we do. We complete learning  a new programming language with lots of tools and dependencies in one week or at most 2 weeks. That being said Python was covered in 2 weeks!
